# Contributing to WDL

OpenWDL strives to be a community-driven project.
As such, it relies on contributions from members of the communityâ€”people such as you! 
Whether you're new to open-source or an experienced project member, we welcome any contribution you're able to provide.
Improvements such as syntax suggestions, feature requests, additions to the documentation, or simply point out typos are all incredibly helpful.
If you're interested, all that is required is to follow the [Contributor Agreement](#contributor-agreement) and follow the [guidelines](#how-to-contribute) laid out here.

# Contributor Agreement

I understand that OpenWDL, the WDL specification, and all of the supporting repositories under the OpenWDL GitHub organization are community-driven.
Any ideas or suggestions I provide may be used by the community and may become part of the official WDL specification under the licenses laid out in the respective repositories.
I attest that all contributions are my own, those contributions are not copyrighted by another party, and that I agree to donate my code to the project under the terms laid out above.

# How to contribute

## Participating in discussions

Discussions (via [GitHub discussions] or RFC [pull requests]) are the lifeblood of the OpenWDL project.
In order for WDL to its goals, such as remaining a human-readable and -writable standard, we rely on our community of individuals to speak up when decisions are being made and ensure the language stays on the right course.

These changes often happen via the [RFC](RFC.md) process and are available for anyone to review, critique, cheer on, or otherwise participate. If you do intend to participate in these discussions, please review and familiarize yourself with that process. 
Beyond RFCs, fellow community members may debate the finer points of proposed changes in the [Slack][slack-invite].
Everyone is invited to participate in any of these forums.

## Code and documentation

We welcome any contribution to an OpenWDL community project, whether that be [the specification](https://github.com/openwdl/wdl), [the documentation](https://github.com/openwdl/docs), [the test suite](https://github.com/openwdl/wdl-tests), or anything else!

To contribute to an existing repository, you can fork the repository in question and make changes to it. Once you're ready, you can [submit a pull request].
    
## The broader ecosystem

A number of people are [building tools](https://docs.openwdl.org/getting-started/ecosystem.html) to make it easier than ever before to utilize WDL or interact with the platforms that support it. If you've created something which you think would be useful we'd love to hear about it!
